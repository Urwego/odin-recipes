        <h2> Description of the menu </h2>
        <p>Lasagna, also known by the plural form lasagne, is a type of pasta made in wide, flat sheets. It originates in Italian cuisine, where it is served in a number of ways, including in broth (lasagne in brodo), but is best known for its use in a baked dish made by stacking layers of pasta, alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices</p>
        <p>Typically, cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients, topped with grated cheese, and then baked in an oven (al forno): regional variations of this dish are found across Italy</p>

        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
            <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
            <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan—like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor</li>
            <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
        </ol>
