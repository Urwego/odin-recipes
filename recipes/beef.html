        <h2>Description of the menu</h2>
        <p> beefsteak, often called just steak, is a flat cut of beef with parallel faces, usually cut perpendicular to the muscle fibers. In common restaurant service a single serving has a raw mass ranging from 120 to 600 grams (4 to 21 oz).</p>
        <p>Beef steaks are usually grilled, pan-fried, or broiled. The more tender cuts from the loin and rib are cooked quickly, using dry heat, and served whole. Less tender cuts from the chuck or round are cooked with moist heat or are mechanically tenderized (as with, for example, cube steak). </p>
        
        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Steak Seasoning</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>f your steak was marinating, wipe off the wet marinade with a paper towel, then set it down on the hot grill and leave it alone for several minutes without turning.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes, the meat will release its grip on the grill, and you can turn it without tearing the meat; If you start to turn it, and it's still gripping the grill, just give it another minute.</li>
            <li>ear steaks over high, direct heat, then move them to indirect heat to finish cooking. That's the most common method. But if you like to live dangerously, do it in reverse: start with indirect cooking, with the lid on, and then finish with a quick, high-heat sear. You'll get the same results: a juicy steak with a crisp, caramelized crust.</li>
            <li>nce your steak is done to your liking, remove it to a plate and let it sit for at least 5 minutes before serving or slicing.</li>
        </ol>
